# req-fast

This module is designed to be the fast, lightweight way to fetch the web content(HTML stream) from specific server. it supports:
- Follow redirects
- Automatic decoding content encodings(avoid messy codes, especially Chinese)
- Cookies
- Gzip/Inflate encoding(automatic decompress)
- Proxy

## Installation
```javascript
npm install req-fast
```

## Usage
```javascript
var req = require('req-fast');
req(options, callback);
```
### Options
When options is instance of **String**, it means the URL of server that to be requested.
```javascript
req('http://www.google.com', function(err, resp){
  // code goes here...
});
```

Otherwise it should be an object, including:
  - **uri || url** A url to which the request is sent.
  - **method** Http method, `GET` as default.
  - **timeout** Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request.
  - **charset** Set charset of content encodings if necessary. **CAUTION:** this option takes top priority of decoding chunks, if not set, the `charset` in `response.headers['content-type']` will be used at first, then the `charset` on `<meta ... />`.
  - **disableRedirect** A value indicating whether disable following redirect or not, if this value was set to `true`, the `maxRedirects` will has no effect.
  - **maxRedirects** The maximum number of redirects to follow(3 as default).
  - **disableGzip** Request compressed content from server and automatic decompress response content, if this option sets to `true`, this feature will be disabled.
  - **cookies** It should be key/value pairs.
  - **headers** Http headers, it should be key/value pairs, and some default values were:

    ```javascript
    {
      'connection': 'keep-alive',
      'accept': 'text/html, text/javascript, application/json, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, */*;q=0.8',
      'pragma': 'no-cache',
      'cache-control': 'no-cache',
      'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/27.0.1453.110 Safari/537.36'
    }
    ```
    > You can override those in the `headers`.
  - **data** Data to be sent to the server, it should be key/value pairs. If the method is not set to `POST`, it will be converted to a query string, and appended to the `url`.
  - **proxy** The proxy including all the options from [tunnel](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tunnel) proxy:
    - **host** A domain name or IP address of the server to issue the proxy request to.
    - **port** Port of remote proxy server..
    - **localAddress** Local interface if necessary.
    - **proxyAuth** Basic authorization for proxy server if necessary, i.e. `username:password`.
    - **headers** An object containing request headers.
### Callback
Function to be called if the request succeeds or fails. The function gets passed two argument:
  - **err** The `Error` instance. if succeeds, this value should be `null`.
  - **response** the response object, including:
    - **body** The response body string.
    - **cookies** The response cookies(key/value pairs).
    - **headers** The response headers(key/value pairs).
    - **redirects** The urls redirect(Array).
    - **statusCode** The response status code.

## Streaming
Stream is amazing in node.js, if you are interesting on it, read [John's Blog](http://ejohn.org/blog/node-js-stream-playground/). You can add listeners on the returning Stream if you want.
```javascript
var rs = req([options]);
rs.on('data', function(chunk){
  // ...
});
rs.on('end', function(resp){
  // ...
});
rs.on('error', function(error){
  // ...
})
```
### Pipe to file
In my project, I will download millions of files from servers, using `pipe` could improving performance, the file downloading from server chunk by chunk, but not read whole file to memory then download once, it sucks.
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
req('http://example.com/beauty.gif').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('download/001.gif'));
```
## TODO
- [ ] More examples
- [ ] Write test cases
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Fix typo bugs

## Thanks
Appreciate to andris9. I've used [fetch](https://github.com/andris9/fetch) for a long time, it's very fast and simple to use.
> my ES Spider needs speed up, [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) is very powerful,
> but too heavy/slow to me, and can not automatic decode encodings, especially Chinese.

Unfortunately andris9 could not maintain his repository any more, it have bugs, also I can fix them
in my project, but it's fussy. One more, I need a PROXY feature.
