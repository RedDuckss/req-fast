## Thanks
Thanks andris9. I've used [fetch](https://github.com/andris9/fetch) for a long time, it's very fast(my ES Spider needs speed up, `request` is
very powerful, but too heavy/slow to me). Unfortunately andris9 could not maintain his repository any more, it have bugs, also I can fix them
in my project, but it's fusssssssy. One more, I need a http request module that supports PROXY.
